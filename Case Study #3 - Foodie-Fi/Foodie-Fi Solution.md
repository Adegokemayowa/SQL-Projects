## Business Task
Danny and his friends launched a new startup Foodie-Fi and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world.

This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions on customer journey, payments, and business performances.



**Table 1: `plans`**

There are 5 customer plans.

- Trial — Customer sign up to an initial 7 day free trial and will automatically continue with the pro monthly subscription plan unless they cancel, downgrade to basic or upgrade to an annual pro plan at any point during the trial.
- Basic plan — Customers have limited access and can only stream their videos and is only available monthly at $9.90.
- Pro plan — Customers have no watch time limits and are able to download videos for offline viewing. Pro plans start at $19.90 a month or $199 for an annual subscription.

When customers cancel their Foodie-Fi service — they will have a Churn plan record with a null price, but their plan will continue until the end of the billing period.

**Table 2: `subscriptions`**

Customer subscriptions show the **exact date** where their specific `plan_id` starts.

If customers downgrade from a pro plan or cancel their subscription — the higher plan will remain in place until the period is over — the `start_date` in the subscriptions table will reflect the date that the actual plan changes.

When customers upgrade their account from a basic plan to a pro or annual pro plan — the higher plan will take effect straightaway.

When customers churn, they will keep their access until the end of their current billing period, but the start_date will be technically the day they decided to cancel their service.

## B. Data Analysis Questions

### 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

To determine the count of unique customers for Foodie-Fi, I utilize the `COUNT()` function wrapped around `DISTINCT`.

```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions;
```

**Answer:**
|count|
|-----|
|1000 |


- Foodie-Fi has 1,000 unique customers.
***
### 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

In other words, the question is asking for the monthly count of users on the trial plan subscription.
- To start, extract the numerical value of month from `start_date` column using the `EXTRACT` function, specifying the 'month' part of a date. 
- Filter the results to retrieve only users with trial plan subscriptions (`plan_id = 0). 

```sql
SELECT 
	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_date) AS month,
	COUNT(*)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 0
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

**Answer:**
|month|count|
|-----|-----|
|1    |	88  |
|2    |	68  |
|3    |	94  |
|4    |	81  |
|5    |	88  |
|6    |	79  |
|7    |	89  |
|8    |	88  |
|9    |	87  | 
|10   |	79  |
|11   |	75  | 
|12   |	84  |


- Among all the months, March has the highest number of trial plans, while February has the lowest number of trial plans.
***
### 3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name.

To put it simply, we have to determine the count of plans with start dates on or after 1 January 2021 grouped by plan names. 
1. Filter plans based on their start dates by including only the plans occurring on or after January 1, 2021.
2. Calculate the number of customers as the number of events. 
3. Group results based on the plan names. 

````sql
SELECT
	plan_name,
	COUNT(*) AS num_of_events
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
JOIN foodie_fi.plans
	USING(plan_id)
WHERE start_date > '2020-12-31'
GROUP BY plan_name;	
````

**Answer:**

| plan_name     | num_of_events |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| basic monthly | 8             |
| pro monthly   | 60            |
| pro annual    | 63            |
| churn         | 71            |
***
### 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?

Let's analyze the question:
- First, we need to determine
  - The number of customers who have churned, meaning those who have discontinued their subscription using a CTE
  - The total number of customers, including both active and churned ones.

- To calculate the churn rate, we divide the number of churned customers by the total number of customers. The result should be rounded to one decimal place.


```sql
WITH churn_cte AS 
(SELECT
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS churned_customers
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 4)
SELECT 
	churned_customers,
	ROUND(100 * churned_customers :: NUMERIC / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id),1) AS pct_churned
FROM
	churn_cte, foodie_fi.subscriptions
GROUP BY churned_customers;
```

**Answer:**
|churned_customers|	pct_churned|
|-----------------|-------------|
|307              |	30.7        | 


- Out of the total customer base of Foodie-Fi, 307 customers have churned. This represents approximately 30.7% of the overall customer count.
***
### 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

Within a CTE called `ranked_cte`, determine which customers churned immediately after the trial plan by utilizing `ROW_NUMBER()` function to assign rankings to each customer's plans. We will be using the `LEAD()` window function

In the outer query:
- Apply 2 conditions in the WHERE clause:
  - Filter `plan_id = 0`. 
  - Filter  `next_plan = 4`.
- Count the number of customers who have churned immediately after their trial period  
- Calculate the churn percentage by dividing the `churned_customers` count by the total count of distinct customer IDs in the `subscriptions` table. Round percentage to a whole number.


```sql
WITH next_plan_cte AS (
	SELECT *,
		LEAD(plan_id, 1) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id 
							  ORDER BY start_date) AS next_plan
	 FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions	 
)
SELECT
	COUNT(*) AS churn_after_trial,
	ROUND(100 * COUNT(*) :: NUMERIC/ 
		  (SELECT
		  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
		  FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions) ,0) AS pct_churned
FROM next_plan_cte
WHERE plan_id = 0
AND next_plan = 4;
```

**Answer:**
|churn_after_trial|	pct_churned|
|  -------------  | ---------  |
|92               |	9          |


- A total of 92 customers churned immediately after the initial free trial period, representing approximately 9% of the entire customer base.
***
### 6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?

```sql
WITH next_plan_cte AS (
	SELECT *,
		LEAD(plan_name, 1) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id 
							  ORDER BY start_date) AS next_plan
	 FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
	 JOIN foodie_fi.plans
	 USING (plan_id )
)
SELECT 
	next_plan,
	COUNT (*) AS count,
	ROUND(100 * COUNT(*) :: NUMERIC/ 
		  (SELECT
		  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
		  FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions) ,1) AS pct
FROM next_plan_cte
WHERE plan_id = 0
	AND next_plan IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY next_plan;
```

**Answer:**


| next_plan     | count | pct    |
| -------       | ------| ------ |
| pro annual    | 37    | 3.7    |
| churn         | 92    | 9.2    |
| pro monthly   | 325   | 32.5   |
| basic monthly | 546   | 54.62  |

- More than 80% of Foodie-Fi's customers are on paid plans with a majority opting for baic and pro monthly plans
- There is potential for improvement in customer acquisition for pro annual plan as only a small percentage of customers are choosing this higher-priced plan.
***
### 7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?

In the cte called `next_date_cte`, we begin by filtering the results to include only the plans with start dates on or before '2020-12-31'. To identify the next start date for each plan, we utilize the `LEAD()` window function.

In the outer query,  we filter the results where the `next_date` is NULL. This step helps us identify the most recent plan that each customer subscribed to as of '2020-12-31'. 

Lastly, we perform calculations to determine the total count of customers and the percentage of customers associated with each trial plan. 

```sql
WITH next_date_cte AS (
	SELECT *,
		LEAD(start_date) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id 
							  ORDER BY start_date) AS next_date
	 FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
	 JOIN foodie_fi.plans
	 USING (plan_id)
	 WHERE start_date <= '2020-12-31'
)
SELECT
	plan_id,
	plan_name,
	COUNT (*) AS customer_count,
	ROUND(100 * COUNT(*) :: NUMERIC/ 
		  (SELECT
		  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
		  FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions) ,1) AS pct
FROM next_date_cte
WHERE next_date IS NULL
GROUP BY plan_id,plan_name;
```

**Answer:**
|plan_id |    plan_name  |	customer_count|	pct |
|--------| ------------- | ---------      | --- |
|0       |	trial        |	19            |	1.9 |
|1       |	basic monthly|	224	          | 22.4|
|2       |	pro monthly  |	326	          | 32.6|
|3       |	pro annual   |	195	          | 19.5|
|4       |	churn	       |  236	          | 23.6|
***

### 8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?

```sql
SELECT
	COUNT (DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 3
	AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) = '2020';
```

**Answer:**
|customer_count|
|--------------|
|195           |


- 195 customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020.
***
### 9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to upgrade to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?

This question is straightforward and the query provided is self-explanatory. 

````sql
-- trial_plan CTE: Filter results to include only the customers subscribed to the trial plan.
  WITH trial_plan AS(
	SELECT 
		customer_id,
		start_date AS trial_date
	FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
	WHERE plan_id = 0
), 
-- annual_plan CTE: Filter results to only include the customers subscribed to the pro annual plan.
 annual_plan AS(
	SELECT 
		customer_id,
		start_date AS annual_date
	FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions

)
-- Find the average of the differences between the start date of a trial plan and a pro annual plan.
SELECT 
	ROUND(AVG (a.annual_date -  t.trial_date)::NUMERIC,0) avg_days_to_upgrade
FROM trial_plan AS t
JOIN annual_plan AS a
	ON t.customer_id = a.customer_id;
````

**Answer:**
|avg_days_to_upgrade|
|-------------------|
|195                |


- On average, customers take approximately 105 days from the day they join Foodie-Fi to upgrade to an annual plan.
***
